    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Football is a sport that due to its complex dynamics, it is very hard to predict. This project aims to evaluate the extent on which formations (which are posted pre-match) have a predictibility significance in the outcome of certain match variables (passes completed, goals scored, and goals conceded). \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a precursor of my possible future undergraduate economics thesis, that will have the aim to use game theory to predict match outcomes. Here we are going to abstract football formations to its simpler form, and just create the groundwork for future more complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project counts with 5 main sections:\n",
    "- **Scapper**: creating a data set from data of the official premier league website\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NetworkX**: Analysing basic the basic connections between player positioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Arrangement**: Combining Data Sets and NetworkX predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Descriptive Analysis**: Looking at the Distribution of Formations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predictive Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Regressions\n",
    "    - Machine Learning\n",
    "    \n",
    "It is important to clarify what we mean by football formation theory. Here, we are going to simplify and breakdown the game as much as possible. As already mentioned, football can be simplified by the following parameters: you choose a formation for 10 players, the playes pass the ball, score goals, and try to not concede goals. During a match, we are going to assume that the formation does not change at least one of the 10 players gets a red card (leave their position for the rest of the match). With NetworkX, we are going to recreate each player's position on the pitch, and create a network (nodes and edges) that represent the range of passing possibilities each player has. Then, we can compare the ranges of passes each time has, and compare if the number of edges/connections influence outcomes as total number of passes, goals scored, and goals conceded.\n",

    "##### Obtaining the MatchIDs of a Given Season \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start by analysing the website of the Premier League (https://www.premierleague.com/home). Here we want to go to results. To do this, lets start by selecting the right URL which is 'https://www.premierleague.com/results?team=FIRST'. Now we are sure we have choosen the right division.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second step is to 'Filter' our desired season. We notice that all matches of that season will appear by scrolling to the end of the page. Each match will count with a MatchID, that can be added to 'https://footballapi.pulselive.com/football/stats/match/' that will give us all the stadistics we need for that match. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our first objective is to create a bot that will give us all the matchIds for any season we command. Because the premier league website works along with requests and requires a lot of clicking, I have selected to use the package Selenium. For instructions on how to download and still Selenium please go to the ReadMe Document in the main repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect to note is that there is one potential frequent change on the website: sometimes there is an advert you have to command the bot to close, and sometimes there is no advert. This advert can be closed with by clicking the X in the top right coner. If you run the code, and it is not completed because there was no add, please uncomment the advert section of the following line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** If you are not able to install Selenium, a CSV with the dataframe is provided in the repository. More details provided in line just before NetworkX section. "
